# RepoCompare
> A React powered single page application that you can easily compare [Github](https://github.com) repositories.

## Installation

```
npm install
npm run build # creates the dist directory, read note below
npm start
open http://localhost:8080
```

*Note: You need to create (build) the `index.html` and `bundle.js` files on root directory, because webpack-dev-server is configured to serve this directory for development.*
